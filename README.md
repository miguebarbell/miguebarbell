### HELLOOOOO ðŸ‘‹, I'm Miguel *(mi-guel)*
> I'm built from some courses but the 80%+ of my real knoledge is from self taught.

ðŸ”­ I finished a goal tracker named [journal](https://journal.debloat.us/demo) that I use everyday. The aim is help everyone who have a fitness goal (run xmiles in a month | lift this amount of weight before xdate), meassure the progress and be proud of the own work.

ðŸ’¬ I have a [blog](https://life.debloat.us) about linux and the unix philosophy.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning react native so I can transfer the knowlegde to the mobile area, but in the far horizont, I'm learning Rust, that's the future.

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm currently moved to gitlab, I found it better privacy friendly there, this is more like social media stuff, so I'm carefull about what have here. Also I have a real mess with the emails that I have here in github, so don't believe in the github's activity overview.
