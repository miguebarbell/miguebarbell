### HELLOOOOO ðŸ‘‹, I'm Miguel *(mi-guel)*
> I'm built from some courses, but 80%+ of my actual knowledge is self-taught.

ðŸ”­ I finished a goal tracker named [journal](https://journal.debloat.us/demo) that I use every day. The aim is to help everyone who has a fitness goal (run x miles in a month | lift this amount of weight before x date), measure their progress and be proud of their work.

ðŸ’¬ I have a [blog](https://life.debloat.us) about Linux and the UNIX philosophy.

ðŸŒ± I aim to be proficient with `Typescript` and `GraphQL`, committed 110% on that, but on the far horizon, I'm learning `Rust`; that's the future (kind of present).

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm currently moved to GitLab; I found it is better privacy-friendly there, this is more like social media stuff, so I'm careful about what I have here. Also, I have a real mess with the emails that I have here on GitHub, so you have to believe in GitHub's activity overview.

# Stay Hard!
