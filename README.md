### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my own fitness journal, I'm a believer that if you implement a tool that you use it everyday, that tool will be a success. The aim is help everyone who have a fitness goal (run xmiles in a month | lift this amount of weight before xdate), meassure the progress and be proud of the own work.



ðŸ’¬ I have a [blog](https://life.debloat.us) about linux and the unix philosophy.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning react native so I can transfer the knowlegde to the mobile area, but in the far horizont, I'm learning Rust, that's the future.

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm currently moved to gitlab, I found it better privacy friendly there, this is more like social media stuff, so I'm carefull about what have here. Also I have a real mess with the emails that I have here in github, so don't believe in the github's activity overview.

# Stay Hard!

ðŸ“« Talk to me, send me an [email](mailto:miguel@debloat.us).
