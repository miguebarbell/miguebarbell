### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my own fitness journal, I'm a believer that if you implement a tool that you use it everyday, that tool will be a success.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning react native so I can transfer the knowlegde to the mobile area, but in the far horizont, I'm learning Rust, that's the future.

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm currently moved to gitlab, I found it better privacy friendly there, this is more like social media stuff, so I'm carefull about what have here.
